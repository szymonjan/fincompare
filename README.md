## Appium, Python, Mac OS and Android. Test environment setup.

Environment setup for mobile app testing is a long and complicated process. First steps that are needed for test environment configuration are going to be different for programming language and framework of your choice. In this example we are using python and slightly modified WTFramework (mods include Python 3 compatibility and HTML reporting). This framework allows for:
* Easy test configuration in YAML file
* Returning test results in HTML file
* Screenshots on test failure
* Support for Page Object Pattern
* Support for Data Driven Testing
* Test run from command line
* Additional test utils

#### Python setup
* Install Python 3.4+:
`$ brew install python`
* Install pip - default package installer for python. It should be included with Python 3.4+ but if not install it manually by running:
`$ sudo easy_install pip`
#### Test environment setup
* Install PyCharm (Community Edition). Itâ€™s the best IDE for Python. It has MANY very useful features that help with everyday work (e.g. UI for git, code refactoring, built-in terminal and more).
Click [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac) to download it.
* Open Pycharm
    * Create a project with interpreter in virtual environment. It is a semi-isolated Python environment that allows packages to be installed for use by a particular application, rather than being installed system wide.
    * Clone this repository. Go to VCS > Git > Clone. Copy this repo URL (https://github.com/szymonjan/mobile_tests.git)
* Install all required packages by running in Terminal:
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Install modified WTFramework from github
`$pip install git+https://github.com/szymonjan/wtframework_mod.git`

During this process you also installed tools that are needed for web apps testing (like Selenium Webdriver and WTFramework). Only thing that is missing is the Chrome browser (you probably already have one) and chromedriver. Put the chromedriver in the `Assets` folder and you are good to go. 
## Appium environment setup
Now we need to configure Appium and Android Studio. This steps are the same no matter of which programming language and framework you choose.

### Install Xcode or Upgrade to 8.3.3
* Goto the Mac Appstore and search for Xcode and click the Get button.
* After installation, install the Commandline Tools.
* Open a terminal and run `$ xcode-select --install`

#### Install Homebrew
* Open a terminal and run `$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
* See additional install instructions [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Installation.md#installation) for further details.
* Test install by running `$ brew --version`. You should see something like Homebrew 1.3.2.

#### Install Carthage
* Open a terminal and run `$ brew install carthage`
   * This is a dependency check for appium-doctor but not really needed for Android. Install it anyway as you may do iOS automation in the future.
   
### Install JAVA
* Open a terminal and check java version: `$ java -version`
	* If the version is less than 1.8 or the command is not recognized you need to install java.
* Go [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* Download and install jdk-8u144-macosx-x64.dmg
* Open Downloads folder and double click the DMG file.
* Double click the JDK 8 install icon.
* Click the Continue button.
* Click the Install button.
* Enter your password to install software on your system.

### Install Node (We need this for parallelization)
* Open a terminal and run `$ brew install node`.
* Test install by running `$ npm --version`. Verify version 5.3.X or greater is returned.
* Test Node is installed by running `$ node -v`. Verify version 8.5.X or greater is returned.

### Install Android Studio
* Click [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#mac-bundle) to download.
* Open downloads folder and double click the Android Studio DMG file.
* Drag and drop the Android Studio icon over to Applications folder. Close the install dialog.
* Open Finder and goto Applications folder. Double click Android Studio.
* Select "I do not have a previous version of studio or I do not want to import my settings" and click OK button.
* Click Next.
* Select Standard Installation and click the Next button.
* Click the Finish button.
* Enter password to allow HAXM to make changes to your system. HAXM is very import for emulator perforamce.
* Click the Finish button.

### Install Android 6.0 SDK 23
* Click the Configure button. It's on the lower right side of the Android Studio welcome dialog.
* Click SDK Manager in the configuration dropdown.
* Select Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) SDK.
   * Why Android 6.0? It's the most common SDK version used throughout the world and is a good starting point until you get more comfortable with mobile automation. See [here](https://www.appbrain.com/stats/top-android-sdk-versions)!
* Click the "Show Package Details" checkbox on lower right.
* Check the following SDK dependencies to install:
   * Android SDK Platform 23
   * Sources for Android 23
   * Intel x86 Atom System Image.
   * Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image.
   * Google API's Intel x86 Atom System Image
   * Google API's Intel X86 Atom_64 System Image
* Click the Apply button.
* On the next screen click the Accept radio button.
* *** Take note of your SDK Path! It's at the top of the Component Installer dialog. e.g SDK Path: /Users/YourUser/Library/Android/sdk
* Click the Next button to start the installation of SDK 23 dependencies. This will take a whie to complete...
* When everything has completed downloading, click the Finish button.
* Click the OK button to close the Component Installer dialog.
* Close Android Studio

### Add Environment Variables
* Determine which shell you use. Open a terminal and run `$ echo $SHELL`.
* Based on your shell, you need to edit your profile. e.g. `$ vi ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile or ~/.zshrc`.
* Add the following variables.
	* export ANDROID_HOME=//Users/YourUser/Library/Android/sdk
	* export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
	* Add the Android sdk paths to your existing PATH=$PATH variable. e.g. :/Users/**your-user-name**/android-sdk-macosx/sdk/tools:/Users/**your-user-name**/android-sdk-macosx/sdk/platform-tools:/Users/**your-user-name**/android-sdk-macosx/sdk/build-tools:
* Save profile. `Press shift + :` type `wq!` and press enter.
* Force close/quit all your terminal windows and open a new one.

### Test Environment Variables
* Run `$ java -version` in terminal. You should see something close to this `java version "1.8.0_144"` or greater is returned.
* Run `$ ruby -v` in terminal. You should see something close to this `ruby 2.4.1` or greater.
* Run `$ emulator -help`. You should see menu options for android emulator manager.
* If any of the above is not working check to make sure the install locations are correct and reflected correctly in the path environment variable.

### Test ADB is installed.
* Run `$ adb` in CMD. You should see this `Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.39` or greater along wiht additional menu options.

### Create Android Emulator
* Run `$ android create avd -n EM1 -k "system-images;android-23;google_apis;x86"` in terminal.
* Enter NO to not create a custom hardware profile.
* Run the emulator: `$ANDROID_HOME/tools/emulator -avd EM1`
	* Verify avd output on startup includes:
	* Hax is enabled
	* HAX is working and emulator runs in fast virt mode.
	* Verify emulator fully starts and you see the android home/desktop screen.
* Note: Emulator can also be created via the AVD Manager IDE inside of Android Studio. However, you would need to create a new project or import one to see this menu option.

### Install Appium Desktop
* Download and install Appium Desktop [here](https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases/download/v1.2.1/appium-desktop-1.2.1.dmg)

### Install Appium Doctor via NPM
* Run `$ npm install -g appium-doctor`
* Run `$ appium-doctor` (checks setup is correct on machine)
	*  	Verify "info AppiumDoctor Everything looks good, bye!" is displayed.
	* If there are things missing please go back to the install instructions above or environment variable setup.

### Install Appium via NPM
* Run `$ npm install -g appium`
	* Verify appium installed correctly by doing `$ appium -v`
